# [Gridland Metro](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/gridland-metro)

The city of Gridland is represented as an `n x m` matrix where the rows are numbered from `1` to `n` and the columns are numbered from `1` to `m`.

Gridland has a network of train tracks that always run in straight horizontal lines along a row. In other words, the start and end points of a train track are `(r1, c1)` and `(r1, c2)`, where `r` represents the row number, `c1` represents the starting column, and `c2` represents the ending column of the train track.

The mayor of Gridland is surveying the city to determine the number of locations where lampposts can be placed. A lamppost can be placed in any cell that is not occupied by a train track.

Given a map of Gridland and its `k` train tracks, find and print the number of cells where the mayor can place lampposts.
