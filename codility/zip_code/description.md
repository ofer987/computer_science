1. The first digit (left-most) is the left-most digit of **a**.
2. the second digit (second left-most) is the left-most digit of **b**.
3. The third digit (third left-most) is the second left-most digit of **a**.
4. The fourth digit (fourth left-most) is the second left-most digit of **b**.
5. Ad-infinitum

If a digit does not exist in either **a** or **b** then skip it.
